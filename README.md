icinga-light
============

Python script(s) to interface with @daniel-git 's usblamp interface and display quick stats from icinga in glorious colour.

Requires http://daniel-git.github.com/usblamp/ to be installed somewhere in $PATH, and a USB Webmail Notifier from Gadgetree or Dream Cheeky hooked up to a USB port.

Also, probably linux, as Windows has a separate executable to interface with the Webmail Notifier.
