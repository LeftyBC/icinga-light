icinga-light
============
icinga-light provides you with a at-a-glance status of your Icinga monitoring in glorious colour.

It's a simple python script that interfaces your Icinga installation with @daniel-git's usblamp interface to a USB Webmail Notifier (from Gadgetree or Dream Cheeky).

Requires http://daniel-git.github.com/usblamp/ to be installed somewhere in $PATH.
